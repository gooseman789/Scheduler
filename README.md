# Description
My motivation for making this project was to better understand how to work with jquery and local storage.
I made this to show my understanding of these topics as well as practice different aspects of the local storage functions.
This solves my issues by giving me reference tool to go back and look into how to do these jquery issues. I will also be using this as a tool for hiring managers.
The largest thing I learned from this project is how to correctly add and recall information from local storage. 

# Installation
I started with cloning the starter code. I then started with making the entire function wait for the page to be loaded first.  I then added the feature for inputting the textarea information into local storage.  Granted, I had to do a lot of research into finding how to use the ID of the large container as the key.  Then i had to work with my current keys and values in local storage for adding them back into the document automatically.  Then I spent a long time coding the coloring changes based on the time of day it is.  

# Usage
